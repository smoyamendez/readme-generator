## Description
---
This is a readme generator that utilizes the inquirer node package to prompt users for the content needed for their project's README. The user's input then generates a markdown file to use for their project. 

## Installation 
---
Make sure you have node js installed. Here is the link if needed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
You can then fork this repo so you have a copy of your own to generate your README files.
After you have forked this repo and have a copy of it locally, in your terminal, change directories into
the location you saved it in. To install the inqirer package, in the command line enter 'npm i inquirer'. 
Once that is downloaded, make sure you are in the root of the folder where the index.js file is. Then run
the command 'node index' and the prompts will come up to answer for your README. After that a file will be
populated in the root folder that is named the title of your project. See below in usage for a video.
